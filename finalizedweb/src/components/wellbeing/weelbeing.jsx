<p className="article-text">Mental health, often overshadowed by its physical counterpart, is an integral component of overall well-being.

It encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social states, influencing how we think, feel, and interact with the world. Just as physical health is essential for our bodies to function optimally, mental health is crucial for our minds to thrive.   

A state of mental well-being allows individuals to harness their full potential, build resilient relationships, and contribute meaningfully to society. It is characterized by a sense of purpose, optimism, and the ability to cope with life's challenges. Conversely, mental health problems can manifest as a range of conditions, from mild to severe, impacting thoughts, moods, and behaviors.
